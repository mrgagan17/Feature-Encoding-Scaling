# Feature-Encoding-Scaling

Objective
The goal of this task is to understand feature engineering techniques such as:
- Label Encoding
- One-Hot Encoding
- Feature Scaling

using the Adult Income Dataset.

---

## Dataset
**Adult Income Dataset**
- Predicts whether a person's income exceeds $50K/year.
- Contains both categorical and numerical features.


## Steps Performed
1. Loaded the dataset using Pandas
2. Identified categorical and numerical features
3. Handled missing values
4. Applied Label Encoding for target variable
5. Applied One-Hot Encoding for categorical features
6. Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler
7. Saved the processed dataset for ML models
